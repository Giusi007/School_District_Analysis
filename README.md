# School_District_Analysis
Analysis of school district assessment data using Python with Pandas. In this analysis, we looked at math and reading scores in 15 high schools in order to determine:
1. A summary of school disctrict statistics.
2. A summary of passing rates at each school.
3. The top 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.
4. The bottom 5 performing schools based on the overall passing rate.
5. The average math score for each grade level from each school.
6. The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
7. The scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type.

While completing this analysis, it was determined that the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School contained inaccurate information due to academic dishonesty. With that information given, we removed both the math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School, and completed the analysis again. In this summary, we will discuss the changes in the data once these scores were removed.
